Copy and paste this to ChatGPT (or DALL-E, Midjourney):

```
Create a modern, minimalist app icon for "SonicBoost" - an AI-powered audio enhancement app.

2. Sound wave ripples emanating from center in purple glow
3. Abstract "S" or "SB" lettermark made of audio frequencies
4. Lightning bolt merged with audio waveform (representing "boost")

Requirements:

- Simple enough to recognize at small sizes (60x60px)
- High contrast, clear at all sizes
- Modern gradient or 3D effect

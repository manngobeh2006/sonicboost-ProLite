## üîß Technical Details

### State Management
- **Zustand** with AsyncStorage persistence
- Separate stores for auth and audio files
- Automatic state hydration on app launch

### Mock Features
Since this is a mobile app prototype without backend infrastructure:

1. **Audio Mastering**: Simulated processing with realistic progress stages. In production, this would connect to an audio mastering API (LANDR, CloudBounce, or custom DSP engine).

2. **File Processing**: Creates copies of the original file as "mastered" versions. In production, actual audio processing algorithms would be applied.

3. **Authentication**: Local mock authentication. In production, integrate with Firebase, Auth0, or custom backend.

4. **Subscription**: Mock Stripe subscription IDs. In production, integrate with Stripe SDK for real subscription management.

5. **Cloud Storage**: Files stored locally. In production, use AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or similar.

### Data Persistence
- User accounts persisted locally
- Audio file history saved
- Subscription status maintained
- Survives app restarts

## üé® UI/UX Design

### Color Scheme
- **Primary**: Purple (#9333EA) - Actions and highlights
- **Background**: Black (#000000) - Main background
- **Surface**: Dark Gray (#111827) - Cards and containers
- **Success**: Green (#10B981) - Completed states
- **Error**: Red (#EF4444) - Errors and warnings

### Design Principles
- Dark theme optimized for audio work
- Large touch targets for mobile
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Consistent spacing and borders
- Professional audio industry aesthetics

## üîÆ Future Enhancements (Production Ready)

To make this production-ready, you would need:

1. **Backend API**: Node.js/Express or Next.js API routes
2. **Real Audio Processing**: Integrate LANDR API, Dolby.io, or custom DSP engine
3. **Cloud Storage**: AWS S3 for audio file storage
4. **Real Authentication**: Firebase, Auth0, or custom JWT
5. **Stripe Integration**: Full payment processing
6. **Database**: PostgreSQL for user data and file metadata
7. **Job Queue**: Bull/Redis for processing queue
8. **WebSocket**: Real-time progress updates
9. **CDN**: CloudFront for fast file delivery
10. **Analytics**: Track usage and conversions

## üìù Notes

- All audio processing is simulated for demonstration
- Files are stored locally on the device
- No actual audio enhancement is performed
- Subscription system is mocked with placeholder Stripe IDs
- This is a fully functional UX prototype showing the complete user flow

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Expo SDK 53 + React Native 0.76.7
- **Navigation**: React Navigation (Native Stack)
- **State Management**: Zustand with AsyncStorage
- **Styling**: NativeWind (Tailwind CSS)
- **Audio**: expo-av
- **File Handling**: expo-document-picker, expo-file-system

## 🚨 Known Limitations

### Current State
- ⚠️ **No automated tests** - Manual testing required
- ⚠️ **No CI/CD pipeline** - Manual builds
- ⚠️ **No user analytics** - Only crash reporting
- ⚠️ **Limited backend scaling** - Good for early users
- ⚠️ **No backup/restore** - Supabase handles this

### When to Upgrade
**Hire developers when:**
- 1,000+ active users
- Complex feature requests
- Need advanced analytics
- Payment processing issues
- Performance problems
- Multiple platform support (web, etc.)

---

## 📈 Scalability Confidence

### ✅ Will Handle:
- **0-10,000 users**: Excellent (Supabase free tier)
- **10,000-50,000 users**: Good (may need Supabase Pro)
- **Network failures**: Auto-retry protects users
- **Backend crashes**: Graceful error messages
- **React errors**: Error boundary prevents app crash

### ⚠️ Potential Issues:
- Very large audio files (>100MB)
- Concurrent processing (limited by OpenAI rate limits)
- Database query optimization (may need indexes)
- Cold starts on Render free tier

### 🛠️ Easy Fixes Available:
- Upgrade Supabase plan ($25/mo)
- Upgrade Render plan ($7/mo)
- Add database indexes
- Implement file size limits
- Add upload progress indicators

---

## 🎓 Maintenance Plan (Until You Hire)

### Weekly (15 min)
- Check Sentry for new crashes
- Review Stripe dashboard
- Check backend logs
- Respond to critical issues

### Monthly (1 hour)
- Review user feedback
- Update dependencies if needed
- Check for security updates
- Plan feature improvements

### As Needed
- Fix critical bugs immediately
- Release updates via EAS
- Respond to App Store reviews

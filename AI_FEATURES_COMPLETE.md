# AI Features Complete ✨

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ AI-Powered Genre Detection
**Before**: Genre detection only used filename keywords, often showing "unknown"

**After**: Two-tier detection system:
1. **Keyword Detection** - Fast detection for obvious filenames
2. **AI Detection** - Uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini to intelligently detect genre from filename when keywords don't match

**Result**: Much more accurate genre detection → Better audio processing tailored to the actual genre

**Example**: 
- File: "my_song_final_mix.mp3" 
- Old: "unknown"
- New: AI analyzes and returns "pop", "rock", etc.

### 2. ✅ AI Revision Feature Restored & Improved
**Location**: ResultsScreen - Shows after audio processing completes

**Access**: **Unlimited Plan Only** (was Pro before)

**How it works**:
- User processes audio → Goes to Results screen
- Unlimited users see "✨ AI Revision (Unlimited)" button
- Clicking opens a modal with text input
- User types commands like:
  - "boost 2kHz by 3dB"
  - "increase bass by 20%"
  - "more brightness"
  - "add warmth"
- AI parses the command and applies the exact adjustment
- Audio is re-processed with new settings
- Can use unlimited times (Unlimited plan only)

**Why Unlimited Only?**
- Premium feature that adds significant value to top tier
- Encourages upgrades from Pro → Unlimited
- Differentiates the $29/mo plan from $11.99/mo Pro

    → Validate response is valid genre
    → Return genre or "unknown"
```

### AI Revision Flow
```
User clicks "✨ AI Revision"
  → Modal opens with text input
  → User enters command
  → parseAudioCommand() - OpenAI parses to structured JSON

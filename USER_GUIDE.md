## 🔧 Technical Notes

### What's Real vs. Simulated

#### ✅ Real (Fully Functional)
- User authentication and persistence
- File picking and validation
- Audio playback
- File export/sharing
- Navigation and UI
- State management
- Progress animations

#### 🎭 Simulated (Demo Only)
- Audio mastering processing (just copies the file)
- Stripe subscription (placeholder IDs)
- Cloud storage (files stored locally)
- Backend API (no server)

### Data Storage Locations
- **User Accounts**: AsyncStorage (`auth-storage`)
- **Audio Files**: AsyncStorage (`audio-storage`)
- **Audio File Data**: Device document directory (`mastered/`)

## 🚀 Making it Production Ready

To turn this into a real app, you need:

1. **Backend Server** (Node.js/Express)
   - User authentication with JWT
   - File upload to cloud storage
   - Job queue management

2. **Audio Processing API**
   - LANDR, CloudBounce, or Dolby.io
   - Or custom DSP engine with Python

3. **Cloud Storage** (AWS S3)
   - Store original files
   - Store mastered files
   - Generate signed URLs

4. **Database** (PostgreSQL)
   - User accounts
   - File metadata
   - Processing history

5. **Stripe Integration**
   - Real subscription management
   - Webhook handling
   - Usage limits

6. **Real-time Updates** (WebSocket)
   - Live progress updates
   - Processing notifications

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### Testing the App
1. Try different audio file formats
2. Test the before/after comparison
3. Upload multiple files to see history
4. Delete files to test cleanup
5. Logout and login to test persistence

### Understanding Progress
- 0-20%: Analyzing (file inspection)
- 21-50%: Tone optimization (EQ processing)
- 51-75%: Dynamics (compression, limiting)
- 76-100%: Finalizing (export, format conversion)

### Best Practices
- Use clear, descriptive filenames
- Keep files under 50MB for best performance
- Download files before deleting from history
- Check subscription status in profile

## 🎉 Success!

You now have a fully functional audio mastering app that demonstrates the complete user flow from signup to download. While the actual audio processing is simulated, all the UI/UX, state management, file handling, and user flows are production-quality.

**Happy Mastering! 🎵**
